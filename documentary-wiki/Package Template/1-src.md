### Main Function

Every package will have a main file specified in the `main` field in the package.json file, unless they have a `bin` field otherwise (in other words, if package does not provide a Node.js API, and only CLI usage). This structure has a minimum example of working function which is exported with `export default` keyword, and documented with JSDoc. It's important to document the config argument in a `typedef` so that other developers are able to see the autocompletion hints when trying to use the function.

%EXAMPLE: node_modules/@mnpjs/package/structure/src/index.js%
