## `Package` Structure

The default package structure is an up-to-date template of a modern Node.js application.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td>

%TREE node_modules/@mnpjs/package/structure -a%
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

It also includes `yarn.lock` file to speed up the installation process.
