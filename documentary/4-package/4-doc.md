### Documentation with `doc`

The documentation is pre-processed with [`documentary`](https://github.com/artdecocode/documentary) which simplifies working on the `README.md` file by allowing to split files, and inserting examples and output text in the docs.

%TREE node_modules/@mnpjs/package/structure/documentary%

To process documentation, the `yarn doc` command can be run.
