## Structures

There are a number of structures available. The default one is the `package` structure.

```table
[
  ["Name", "Description", "Link"],
  ["`package`", "[`Art Deco Node.js Package`](t). It has everything needed to create high-quality modern application with testing, building and documentation facilities.", "[`@mnpjs/package`](https://github.com/mnpjs/package)"],
  ["`idio`", "The [@idio/core web server](t) structure. Fast backend with Facebook auth and dotenv support.", "[`@mnpjs/idio`](https://github.com/mnpjs/idio)"],
  ["azure", "The [Azure functions app](t) structure for creating serverless APIs.", "[`@mnpjs/structure`](https://github.com/mnpjs/azure)"],
  ["structure", "The structure for [creating new structures](t) with `mnp`.", "[`@mnpjs/structure`](https://github.com/mnpjs/structure)"]
