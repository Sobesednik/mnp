## Structures

There are a number of structures available. The default one is the `package` structure.

```table
[
  ["Name", "Description", "Link"],
  ["`package`", "[`An Art Deco Node.js Package`](t). It has everything needed to create high-quality modern application with testing, building and documentation facilities.", "[`@mnp/package`](https://github.com/mnpjs/package)"],
  ["`idio`", "A [Universal Koa Website](t) that allows to write server-side JSX and provides Hot Module Reload.", "[`mnp-idio`](https://github.com/artdecocode/mnp-idio)"],
  ["structure", "A structure for creating new structures with `mnp`.", "[`mnp-structure`](https://github.com/artdecocode/mnp-structure)"]
]
```
